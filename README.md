# dotenv

Yet another Go port of [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeeper/dotenv) environment variable dot-file library.

## Installation

```shell
go get github.com/stackus/dotenv
```

## Usage

Add your application configuration to your `.env` file in the root of your project:

```shell
S3_BUCKET=YOURS3BUCKET
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE
```

### Load()

Use `Load()` to inject the variables read from the files into the current processes environment variables.

Load the variables in Go like the following:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	
	"github.com/stackus/dotenv"
)

func main() {
    if err := dotenv.Load(); err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "error starting application: %s", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
	
    s3Bucket := os.Getenv("S3_BUCKET")
    secretKey := os.Getenv("SECRET_KEY")
	
    // ...
}
```

### Parse()

If you do not want to alter the environment variables you can use `Parse()` to return all of the values read from the file as a `map[string]string`.

```go
// ...

values, err := dotenv.Parse()

s3Bucket := values['S3_BUCKET']

// ...
```

### Defaults
| Setting | Default | Purpose                                                               |
| --- | --- |-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Files  | .env | Names of the files that should be parsed for values                   |
| Paths | . | Paths that should be searched for files                               |
| Overload | false | Replace existing environment variables with values read in from files |
| RequireAllFiles | false | Silently skip any files that could not be found and read              |
| RequiredKeys | [] | List of keys that must exist in the environment                       |
### Options

Both `Load()` and `Parse()` accept options that will alter how they work.

#### Files(...string)
Provide a list of file names to read values from.

#### Paths(...string)
Provide a list of paths to search for files with values.

#### Overload()
> This is a `Load()` only option.

Replace any existing values that either were already set in the environment variables or were set from a previously read file.

#### RequiredKeys(...string)
> This is a `Load()` only option.

Provides a list of keys that will be checked just before `Load()` is done. If any of the keys are not set in the environment then `Load()` will return an error message listing all missing keys.

#### AllFilesRequired()
This will cause either `Load()` or `Parse()` to return an error when the first missing file is encountered.

#### EnvironmentFiles(string)
Sets a group of files using the given environment name.

| environment | Result                                                           |
| --- |------------------------------------------------------------------|
| test | .env.test.local, .env.test, .env                                 |
| anything else | .env.\<environment>.local, .env.local, .env.\<environment>, .env |

#### Using Options

You can pass in any combination of options you need to either `Load()` or `Parse()`.

```go

err := dotenv.Load(
        dotenv.EnvironmentFiles(os.Getenv("MY_APP_ENV")),
        dotenv.RequireKeys("DATABASE_URL", "HOST", "LOG_LEVEL"),
    )

// the same goes for Parse()
```

### Autoload
There is an autoload as well if you do not need to make use of any of the options.

```go
package main

import (
	_ "github.com/stackus/dotenv/autoload"
)

func main() {
    // values have already been loaded
}

```

### Similarities with the Ruby version

Nearly everything the Ruby version would parse is parsed in this version. With one major difference. There is no command substitution.

```env
# start simple and go from there
FOO=bar             # bar
FOO1=bar#baz        # bar#baz
FOO2=fizz buzz      # fizz buzz
FOO3="bar"          # bar
FOO4= "bar"         # bar
FOO5 = "bar"        # bar
FOO6="foo$FOO5"     # foobar
FOO7="foo\$FOO5"    # foo$FOO5
FOO8="a multi
line value"         # a multi\nline value
BAR1='foo'          # foo
BAR2='bar$BAR1'     # bar$BAR1
BAR3: yaml-like     # yaml-like
export BAR4=bar     # bar
export UNDEFINED    # this will return a warning error just as the Ruby version does
```

> It also doesn't parse `"FOO=foo\rBAR=bar"` (strings that use only a carriage return) correctly.
